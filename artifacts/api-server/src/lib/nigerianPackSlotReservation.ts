/**
 * PHASE N1-S2 — Nigerian Pack Slot Reservation.
 *
 * Reserves up to 2 of `desiredCount` final shipped slots for
 * Nigerian-pack candidates when the four-AND activation guard is
 * satisfied (`canActivateNigerianPack`). For desiredCount=3 the
 * composed batch is:
 *
 *   ≥2 distinct pack candidates : [topPack, topNonPack, secondPack]
 *    1 pack candidate           : [topPack, topNonPack, nextNonPack]
 *    0 pack candidates          : selectionBatch returned unchanged
 *
 * Hard rules honoured:
 *   • Activation guard short-circuits to identity for every cohort
 *     other than nigeria + pidgin/light_pidgin + flag ON + non-empty
 *     pack — flag-OFF and non-eligible cohorts are byte-identical to
 *     the upstream `selection.batch`.
 *   • Pack candidates are drawn ONLY from the post-validation
 *     `candidatePool` — every entry in that pool has already passed
 *     `ideaSchema`, `validateScenarioCoherence`, `validateComedy`,
 *     and `validateAntiCopyDetailed`. No validator is touched here.
 *   • Per-batch dedup: no two reserved slots share a
 *     `nigerianPackEntryId` and no two slots share a normalized hook.
 *   • Non-pack slots preserve the order produced by upstream
 *     `selectWithNovelty` + `applyBatchComposition`, so trend-cap,
 *     hero/taste composition, and willingness ordering all remain
 *     authoritative for the non-reserved positions.
 *   • No score boost. No global change to `scoreHookQuality`. No
 *     mutation of any candidate's `meta`. Pure reorder.

   * Optional set of `nigerianPackEntryId` values the creator has
   * already seen in a recent shipped batch. Pack candidates whose

   * BEFORE the reserve-vs-non-pack composition runs, so the

   * byte-identical to the baseline).

  // shrink the batch) used to return the upstream selection
  // verbatim. That batch is produced by `selectWithNovelty` +
  // `applyBatchComposition` upstream, neither of which is aware of

  // selection, the fallback would re-ship the seen entry, defeating
  // the per-creator memory contract.
  //
  // This helper strips excluded pack entries from any batch we are
  // about to return through a fallback path. When `excludeEntryIds`
  // is undefined or empty the helper is a no-op (`batch` is returned
  // by reference unchanged), preserving the byte-identical baseline
  // for non-NG cohorts and for tests that don't pass the field.

  // batch below `desiredCount`, we accept the smaller batch rather
